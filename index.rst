Welcome to the DISTRO_CT Documentation!
=======================================

**DITROS** is a set of solutions/services using innovation and digital technology to advance road safety in general and enable governments and other public/private organizations to achieve the UN's road safety goals. Its "Technical Control" module is intended for Technical Control Centers in interested countries. This user manual for the DITROS CT software aims to help the personnel of technical control centers master the tool that will enable them to carry out the process of producing technical inspection stickers. This user manual provides an overview of the application's features and gives step-by-step instructions for conducting a vehicle's technical inspection. This document will primarily cover four (04) main parts: an introduction to the equipment, an introduction to the roles, the procedure for issuing a report for an initial inspection, and finally, the procedure for conducting a re-inspection.
